DESCRIPTION
       MAN  IS  THE  SYSTEM'S MANUAL PAGER. EACH PAGE ARGUMENT GIVEN
       TO MAN IS NORMALLY THE NAME OF A PROGRAM, UTILITY OR FUNCTION.
       THE MANUAL PAGE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE ARGUMENTS IS
       THEN  FOUND  AND  DIS‐ PLAYED.  A  SECTION,  IF  PROVIDED,
       WILL  DIRECT  MAN TO LOOK ONLY IN THAT SECTION OF THE MANUAL.
       THE DEFAULT ACTION IS TO SEARCH IN ALL OF THE AVAILABLE SECTIONS,
       FOLLOWING A PRE-DEFINED ORDER AND TO SHOW ONLY THE FIRST PAGE
       FOUND, EVEN IF PAGE EXISTS IN SEVERAL SECTIONS.

       THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE SECTION NUMBERS OF THE MANUAL FOLLOWED
       BY THE TYPES OF PAGES THEY CONTAIN.


       1   EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS OR SHELL COMMANDS 2   SYSTEM CALLS
       (FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY THE KERNEL) 3   LIBRARY CALLS (FUNCTIONS
       WITHIN PROGRAM LIBRARIES) 4   SPECIAL FILES (USUALLY FOUND IN
       /DEV) 5   FILE FORMATS AND CONVENTIONS EG /ETC/PASSWD 6   GAMES
       7   MISCELLANEOUS  (INCLUDING  MACRO  PACKAGES AND CONVEN‐
           TIONS), E.G. MAN(7), GROFF(7)
       8   SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION COMMANDS (USUALLY ONLY FOR ROOT)
       9   KERNEL ROUTINES [NON STANDARD]

       A MANUAL PAGE CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SECTIONS.

       CONVENTIONAL SECTION NAMES INCLUDE NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION,
       DESCRIPTION,  OPTIONS,  EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,
       ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE,
       AUTHORS, AND SEE ALSO.

       THE FOLLOWING CONVENTIONS APPLY TO THE SYNOPSIS SECTION AND CAN
       BE USED AS A GUIDE IN OTHER SECTIONS.


       BOLD TEXT          TYPE EXACTLY AS SHOWN.  ITALIC TEXT
       REPLACE WITH APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT.  [-ABC]             ANY OR ALL
       ARGUMENTS WITHIN [ ] ARE OPTIONAL.  -A|-B              OPTIONS
       DELIMITED BY | CANNOT BE USED TOGETHER.  ARGUMENT ...
       ARGUMENT IS REPEATABLE.  [EXPRESSION] ...   ENTIRE EXPRESSION
       WITHIN [ ] IS REPEATABLE.

       EXACT RENDERING MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE OUTPUT DEVICE.
       FOR INSTANCE, MAN WILL USUALLY NOT BE ABLE TO RENDER ITALICS
       WHEN RUNNING IN A TERMINAL, AND WILL TYPICALLY USE UNDERLINED OR
       COLOURED TEXT INSTEAD.

       THE  COMMAND OR FUNCTION ILLUSTRATION IS A PATTERN THAT SHOULD
       MATCH ALL POSSIBLE INVOCATIONS.  IN SOME CASES IT IS ADVISABLE
       TO ILLUSTRATE SEVERAL EXCLUSIVE INVOCATIONS AS IS SHOWN IN THE
       SYNOPSIS  SECTION OF THIS MANUAL PAGE.

EXAMPLES
       MAN LS
           DISPLAY THE MANUAL PAGE FOR THE ITEM (PROGRAM) LS.

       MAN -A INTRO
           DISPLAY, IN SUCCESSION, ALL OF THE AVAILABLE INTRO MANUAL
           PAGES CONTAINED WITHIN THE MANUAL.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO QUIT
           BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE DISPLAYS OR SKIP ANY OF THEM.

       MAN -T ALIAS | LPR -PPS
           FORMAT THE MANUAL PAGE REFERENCED BY `ALIAS', USUALLY A
           SHELL MANUAL PAGE, INTO THE  DEFAULT  TROFF OR GROFF FORMAT
           AND PIPE IT TO THE PRINTER NAMED PS.  THE DEFAULT OUTPUT FOR
           GROFF IS USUALLY POST‐ SCRIPT.  MAN --HELP SHOULD ADVISE
           AS TO WHICH PROCESSOR IS BOUND TO THE -T OPTION.

       MAN -L -TDVI ./FOO.1X.GZ > ./FOO.1X.DVI
           THIS COMMAND WILL DECOMPRESS AND FORMAT THE NROFF SOURCE MANUAL
           PAGE  ./FOO.1X.GZ  INTO  A  DEVICE INDEPENDENT  (DVI)  FILE.
           THE REDIRECTION IS NECESSARY AS THE -T FLAG CAUSES OUTPUT
           TO BE DIRECTED TO STDOUT WITH NO PAGER.  THE OUTPUT COULD
           BE VIEWED WITH A PROGRAM SUCH AS XDVI  OR  FURTHER  PRO‐
           CESSED INTO POSTSCRIPT USING A PROGRAM SUCH AS DVIPS.

       MAN -K PRINTF
           SEARCH  THE  SHORT DESCRIPTIONS AND MANUAL PAGE NAMES FOR THE
           KEYWORD PRINTF AS REGULAR EXPRESSION.  PRINT OUT ANY MATCHES.
           EQUIVALENT TO APROPOS -R PRINTF.

       MAN -F SMAIL
           LOOKUP THE MANUAL PAGES REFERENCED BY SMAIL AND PRINT OUT THE
           SHORT  DESCRIPTIONS  OF  ANY  FOUND.  EQUIVALENT TO WHATIS
           -R SMAIL.

OVERVIEW
       MANY  OPTIONS  ARE  AVAILABLE  TO  MAN  IN  ORDER  TO GIVE AS
       MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE TO THE USER.  CHANGES CAN BE MADE
       TO THE SEARCH PATH, SECTION ORDER, OUTPUT PROCESSOR, AND OTHER
       BEHAVIOURS AND OPER‐ ATIONS DETAILED BELOW.

       IF SET, VARIOUS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE INTERROGATED TO DETERMINE
       THE OPERATION OF MAN.  IT IS POSSI‐ BLE TO SET THE `CATCH ALL'
       VARIABLE $MANOPT TO ANY STRING IN COMMAND LINE  FORMAT  WITH  THE
       EXCEPTION THAT  ANY  SPACES  USED AS PART OF AN OPTION'S ARGUMENT
       MUST BE ESCAPED (PRECEDED BY A BACKSLASH).  MAN WILL PARSE
       $MANOPT PRIOR TO PARSING ITS OWN COMMAND LINE.  THOSE OPTIONS
       REQUIRING AN ARGUMENT WILL  BE OVERRIDDEN  BY THE SAME OPTIONS
       FOUND ON THE COMMAND LINE.  TO RESET ALL OF THE OPTIONS SET IN
       $MANOPT, -D CAN BE SPECIFIED AS THE INITIAL COMMAND LINE OPTION.
       THIS WILL ALLOW  MAN  TO  `FORGET'  ABOUT  THE OPTIONS SPECIFIED
       IN $MANOPT ALTHOUGH THEY MUST STILL HAVE BEEN VALID.

       THE  MANUAL  PAGER  UTILITIES  PACKAGED  AS  MAN-DB MAKE EXTENSIVE
       USE OF INDEX DATABASE CACHES.  THESE CACHES CONTAIN INFORMATION
       SUCH AS WHERE EACH MANUAL PAGE CAN BE FOUND ON THE FILESYSTEM AND
       WHAT  ITS WHATIS  (SHORT  ONE  LINE DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN PAGE)
       CONTAINS, AND ALLOW MAN TO RUN FASTER THAN IF IT HAD TO SEARCH
       THE FILESYSTEM EACH TIME TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE MANUAL PAGE.
       IF REQUESTED USING THE  -U OPTION,  MAN  WILL ENSURE THAT THE
       CACHES REMAIN CONSISTENT, WHICH CAN OBVIATE THE NEED TO MANUALLY
       RUN SOFTWARE TO UPDATE TRADITIONAL WHATIS TEXT DATABASES.

       IF MAN CANNOT FIND A MANDB INITIATED INDEX DATABASE FOR A
       PARTICULAR MANUAL  PAGE  HIERARCHY,  IT  WILL STILL  SEARCH
       FOR THE REQUESTED MANUAL PAGES, ALTHOUGH FILE GLOBBING WILL BE
       NECESSARY TO SEARCH WITHIN THAT HIERARCHY.  IF WHATIS OR APROPOS
       FAILS TO FIND AN INDEX IT WILL TRY TO EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM
       A TRADITIONAL WHATIS DATABASE INSTEAD.

       THESE  UTILITIES SUPPORT COMPRESSED SOURCE NROFF FILES HAVING,
       BY DEFAULT, THE EXTENSIONS OF .Z, .Z AND .GZ.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO
       DEAL WITH ANY COMPRESSION EXTENSION, BUT THIS INFORMATION MUST
       BE KNOWN AT COM‐ PILE  TIME.   ALSO, BY DEFAULT, ANY CAT PAGES
       PRODUCED ARE COMPRESSED USING GZIP.  EACH `GLOBAL' MANUAL PAGE
       HIERARCHY SUCH AS /USR/SHARE/MAN OR /USR/X11R6/MAN MAY HAVE ANY
       DIRECTORY AS ITS CAT PAGE  HIERAR‐ CHY.  TRADITIONALLY THE CAT
       PAGES ARE STORED UNDER THE SAME HIERARCHY AS THE MAN PAGES, BUT
       FOR REASONS SUCH AS THOSE SPECIFIED IN THE FILE HIERARCHY STANDARD
       (FHS), IT MAY BE BETTER TO STORE THEM ELSEWHERE.  FOR  DETAILS
       ON HOW TO DO THIS, PLEASE READ MANPATH(5).  FOR DETAILS ON WHY
       TO DO THIS, READ THE STAN‐ DARD.

       INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE WITH THIS PACKAGE.  NATIVE
       LANGUAGE MANUAL PAGES ARE ACCESSIBLE  (IF AVAILABLE  ON  YOUR
       SYSTEM) VIA USE OF LOCALE FUNCTIONS.  TO ACTIVATE SUCH SUPPORT,
       IT IS NECESSARY TO SET EITHER $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG OR ANOTHER
       SYSTEM  DEPENDENT  ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLE  TO  YOUR  LANGUAGE
       LOCALE, USUALLY SPECIFIED IN THE POSIX 1003.1 BASED FORMAT:

       <LANGUAGE>[_<TERRITORY>[.<CHARACTER-SET>[,<VERSION>]]]

       IF  THE DESIRED PAGE IS AVAILABLE IN YOUR LOCALE, IT WILL BE
       DISPLAYED IN LIEU OF THE STANDARD (USUALLY AMERICAN ENGLISH) PAGE.

       SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL MESSAGE CATALOGUES IS ALSO FEATURED IN
       THIS PACKAGE AND CAN BE  ACTIVATED  IN THE  SAME  WAY,  AGAIN
       IF AVAILABLE.  IF YOU FIND THAT THE MANUAL PAGES AND MESSAGE
       CATALOGUES SUPPLIED WITH THIS PACKAGE ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR
       NATIVE LANGUAGE AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUPPLY  THEM,  PLEASE
       CONTACT THE MAINTAINER WHO WILL BE COORDINATING SUCH ACTIVITY.

       FOR  INFORMATION  REGARDING OTHER FEATURES AND EXTENSIONS AVAILABLE
       WITH THIS MANUAL PAGER, PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENTS SUPPLIED WITH
       THE PACKAGE.

DEFAULTS
       MAN WILL SEARCH FOR THE DESIRED MANUAL PAGES WITHIN THE INDEX
       DATABASE CACHES.  IF  THE  -U  OPTION  IS GIVEN,  A  CACHE
       CONSISTENCY CHECK IS PERFORMED TO ENSURE THE DATABASES ACCURATELY
       REFLECT THE FILESYS‐ TEM.  IF THIS OPTION IS ALWAYS GIVEN, IT
       IS NOT GENERALLY NECESSARY TO RUN MANDB AFTER THE  CACHES  ARE
       INITIALLY CREATED, UNLESS A CACHE BECOMES CORRUPT.  HOWEVER,
       THE CACHE CONSISTENCY CHECK CAN BE SLOW ON SYSTEMS WITH MANY
       MANUAL PAGES INSTALLED, SO IT IS NOT PERFORMED BY DEFAULT, AND
       SYSTEM  ADMINISTRATORS MAY WISH TO RUN MANDB EVERY WEEK OR SO TO
       KEEP THE DATABASE CACHES FRESH.  TO FORESTALL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY
       OUTDATED CACHES, MAN WILL FALL BACK TO FILE GLOBBING IF A CACHE
       LOOKUP FAILS, JUST AS IT WOULD IF NO CACHE WAS PRESENT.

       ONCE  A MANUAL PAGE HAS BEEN LOCATED, A CHECK IS PERFORMED TO FIND
       OUT IF A RELATIVE PREFORMATTED `CAT' FILE ALREADY EXISTS AND IS
       NEWER THAN THE NROFF FILE.  IF IT DOES AND IS,  THIS  PREFORMATTED
       FILE  IS (USUALLY)  DECOMPRESSED AND THEN DISPLAYED, VIA USE OF
       A PAGER.  THE PAGER CAN BE SPECIFIED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, OR ELSE
       WILL FALL BACK TO A DEFAULT IS USED (SEE OPTION -P FOR DETAILS).
       IF NO CAT  IS  FOUND OR  IS  OLDER  THAN THE NROFF FILE, THE NROFF
       IS FILTERED THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND IS SHOWN IMMEDI‐ ATELY.

       IF A CAT FILE CAN BE PRODUCED (A RELATIVE CAT DIRECTORY EXISTS
       AND HAS  APPROPRIATE  PERMISSIONS),  MAN WILL COMPRESS AND STORE
       THE CAT FILE IN THE BACKGROUND.

       THE FILTERS ARE DECIPHERED BY A NUMBER OF MEANS. FIRSTLY, THE
       COMMAND LINE OPTION -P OR THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE $MANROFFSEQ
       IS INTERROGATED. IF -P WAS NOT USED AND THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
       WAS NOT SET,  THE INITIAL  LINE  OF  THE NROFF FILE IS PARSED FOR
       A PREPROCESSOR STRING.  TO CONTAIN A VALID PREPROCESSOR STRING,
       THE FIRST LINE MUST RESEMBLE

       '\" <STRING>

       WHERE STRING CAN BE ANY COMBINATION OF LETTERS DESCRIBED BY OPTION
       -P BELOW.

       IF NONE OF THE ABOVE METHODS PROVIDE ANY FILTER INFORMATION,
       A DEFAULT SET IS USED.

       A FORMATTING PIPELINE IS FORMED FROM THE FILTERS AND THE
       PRIMARY FORMATTER (NROFF OR [TG]ROFF WITH  -T) AND EXECUTED.
       ALTERNATIVELY, IF AN EXECUTABLE PROGRAM MANDB_NFMT (OR MANDB_TFMT
       WITH -T) EXISTS IN THE MAN TREE ROOT, IT IS EXECUTED INSTEAD.
       IT GETS PASSED THE MANUAL SOURCE FILE, THE PREPROCESSOR STRING,
       AND OPTIONALLY THE DEVICE SPECIFIED WITH -T OR -E AS ARGUMENTS.

OPTIONS
       NON ARGUMENT OPTIONS THAT ARE DUPLICATED EITHER ON THE COMMAND
       LINE, IN $MANOPT, OR BOTH, ARE NOT HARM‐ FUL.  FOR OPTIONS THAT
       REQUIRE AN ARGUMENT, EACH DUPLICATION WILL OVERRIDE THE PREVIOUS
       ARGUMENT VALUE.

   GENERAL OPTIONS
       -C FILE, --CONFIG-FILE=FILE
              USE THIS USER CONFIGURATION FILE RATHER THAN THE DEFAULT
              OF ~/.MANPATH.

       -D, --DEBUG
              PRINT DEBUGGING INFORMATION.

       -D, --DEFAULT
              THIS OPTION IS NORMALLY ISSUED AS THE VERY FIRST  OPTION
              AND  RESETS  MAN'S  BEHAVIOUR  TO  ITS DEFAULT.  ITS USE IS
              TO RESET THOSE OPTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SET IN $MANOPT.
              ANY OPTIONS THAT FOLLOW -D WILL HAVE THEIR USUAL EFFECT.

       --WARNINGS[=WARNINGS]
              ENABLE WARNINGS FROM GROFF.  THIS MAY BE USED TO PERFORM
              SANITY CHECKS ON  THE  SOURCE  TEXT  OF MANUAL  PAGES.
              WARNINGS IS A COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF WARNING NAMES;
              IF IT IS NOT SUPPLIED, THE DEFAULT IS "MAC".  SEE THE
              “WARNINGS” NODE IN INFO GROFF FOR A LIST OF AVAILABLE
              WARNING NAMES.

   MAIN MODES OF OPERATION
       -F, --WHATIS
              EQUIVALENT TO WHATIS.  DISPLAY A SHORT DESCRIPTION FROM  THE
              MANUAL  PAGE,  IF  AVAILABLE.  SEE WHATIS(1) FOR DETAILS.

       -K, --APROPOS
              EQUIVALENT  TO  APROPOS.  SEARCH THE SHORT MANUAL PAGE
              DESCRIPTIONS FOR KEYWORDS AND DISPLAY ANY MATCHES.
              SEE APROPOS(1) FOR DETAILS.

       -K, --GLOBAL-APROPOS
              SEARCH FOR TEXT IN ALL MANUAL PAGES.  THIS IS A BRUTE-FORCE
              SEARCH, AND IS LIKELY TO  TAKE  SOME TIME;  IF  YOU  CAN,
              YOU SHOULD SPECIFY A SECTION TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PAGES
              THAT NEED TO BE SEARCHED.  SEARCH TERMS MAY BE SIMPLE
              STRINGS (THE  DEFAULT),  OR  REGULAR  EXPRESSIONS  IF  THE
              --REGEX OPTION IS USED.

       -L, --LOCAL-FILE
              ACTIVATE  `LOCAL'  MODE.  FORMAT AND DISPLAY LOCAL MANUAL
              FILES INSTEAD OF SEARCHING THROUGH THE SYSTEM'S MANUAL
              COLLECTION.  EACH MANUAL PAGE ARGUMENT WILL BE INTERPRETED
              AS  AN  NROFF  SOURCE FILE IN THE CORRECT FORMAT.  NO CAT
              FILE IS PRODUCED.  IF '-' IS LISTED AS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS,
              INPUT WILL BE TAKEN FROM STDIN.  WHEN THIS OPTION IS NOT
              USED, AND MAN FAILS TO  FIND  THE  PAGE REQUIRED,  BEFORE
              DISPLAYING  THE  ERROR MESSAGE, IT ATTEMPTS TO ACT AS IF
              THIS OPTION WAS SUP‐ PLIED, USING THE NAME AS A FILENAME
              AND LOOKING FOR AN EXACT MATCH.

       -W, --WHERE, --LOCATION
              DON'T ACTUALLY DISPLAY THE MANUAL PAGES, BUT DO PRINT
              THE LOCATION(S) OF THE SOURCE NROFF  FILES THAT WOULD
              BE FORMATTED.

       -W, --WHERE-CAT, --LOCATION-CAT
              DON'T  ACTUALLY  DISPLAY  THE  MANUAL  PAGES, BUT DO PRINT
              THE LOCATION(S) OF THE CAT FILES THAT WOULD BE DISPLAYED.
              IF -W AND -W ARE BOTH SPECIFIED, PRINT BOTH SEPARATED BY
              A SPACE.

       -C, --CATMAN
              THIS OPTION IS NOT FOR GENERAL USE AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED
              BY THE CATMAN PROGRAM.

       -R ENCODING, --RECODE=ENCODING
              INSTEAD OF FORMATTING THE MANUAL PAGE IN THE USUAL WAY,
              OUTPUT ITS SOURCE CONVERTED TO THE SPEC‐ IFIED  ENCODING.
              IF  YOU  ALREADY  KNOW THE ENCODING OF THE SOURCE FILE,
              YOU CAN ALSO USE MAN‐ CONV(1) DIRECTLY.  HOWEVER, THIS
              OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO CONVERT SEVERAL MANUAL PAGES TO  A
              SINGLE ENCODING  WITHOUT  HAVING  TO  EXPLICITLY  STATE
              THE  ENCODING OF EACH, PROVIDED THAT THEY WERE ALREADY
              INSTALLED IN A STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO A MANUAL PAGE HIERARCHY.

   FINDING MANUAL PAGES
       -L LOCALE, --LOCALE=LOCALE
              MAN WILL NORMALLY DETERMINE YOUR CURRENT LOCALE BY A CALL TO
              THE C FUNCTION  SETLOCALE(3)  WHICH INTERROGATES  VARIOUS
              ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, POSSIBLY INCLUDING $LC_MESSAGES
              AND $LANG.  TO TEM‐ PORARILY OVERRIDE THE DETERMINED
              VALUE, USE THIS OPTION TO SUPPLY A LOCALE  STRING  DIRECTLY
              TO MAN.  NOTE THAT IT WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE SEARCH
              FOR PAGES ACTUALLY BEGINS.  OUTPUT SUCH AS THE HELP MESSAGE
              WILL ALWAYS BE DISPLAYED IN THE INITIALLY DETERMINED LOCALE.

       -M SYSTEM[,...], --SYSTEMS=SYSTEM[,...]
              IF THIS SYSTEM HAS ACCESS TO OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM'S
              MANUAL PAGES, THEY CAN BE  ACCESSED  USING THIS OPTION.
              TO SEARCH FOR A MANUAL PAGE FROM NEWOS'S MANUAL PAGE
              COLLECTION, USE THE OPTION -M NEWOS.

              THE SYSTEM SPECIFIED CAN BE A COMBINATION OF COMMA DELIMITED
              OPERATING SYSTEM NAMES.  TO INCLUDE A SEARCH OF THE NATIVE
              OPERATING SYSTEM'S MANUAL PAGES, INCLUDE THE SYSTEM NAME
              MAN IN THE ARGU‐ MENT STRING.  THIS OPTION WILL OVERRIDE
              THE $SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.

       -M PATH, --MANPATH=PATH
              SPECIFY AN ALTERNATE MANPATH TO USE.  BY DEFAULT, MAN USES
              MANPATH DERIVED CODE TO DETERMINE THE PATH TO SEARCH.
              THIS OPTION OVERRIDES THE $MANPATH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
              AND CAUSES OPTION -M TO BE IGNORED.

              A PATH SPECIFIED AS A MANPATH MUST BE THE ROOT OF A MANUAL
              PAGE HIERARCHY STRUCTURED  INTO  SEC‐ TIONS  AS DESCRIBED
              IN THE MAN-DB MANUAL (UNDER "THE MANUAL PAGE SYSTEM").
              TO VIEW MANUAL PAGES OUTSIDE SUCH HIERARCHIES, SEE THE
              -L OPTION.

       -S LIST, -S LIST, --SECTIONS=LIST
              LIST IS A COLON- OR COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF `ORDER SPECIFIC'
              MANUAL SECTIONS  TO  SEARCH.   THIS OPTION  OVERRIDES THE
              $MANSECT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.  (THE -S SPELLING IS FOR
              COMPATIBILITY WITH SYSTEM V.)

       -E SUB-EXTENSION, --EXTENSION=SUB-EXTENSION
              SOME SYSTEMS INCORPORATE LARGE PACKAGES OF MANUAL PAGES,
              SUCH AS THOSE THAT  ACCOMPANY  THE  TCL PACKAGE,  INTO  THE
              MAIN MANUAL PAGE HIERARCHY.  TO GET AROUND THE PROBLEM OF
              HAVING TWO MANUAL PAGES WITH THE SAME NAME SUCH AS EXIT(3),
              THE TCL PAGES WERE USUALLY ALL ASSIGNED TO SECTION  L.
              AS  THIS  IS  UNFORTUNATE,  IT  IS  NOW POSSIBLE TO
              PUT THE PAGES IN THE CORRECT SECTION, AND TO ASSIGN A
              SPECIFIC `EXTENSION' TO THEM, IN THIS CASE, EXIT(3TCL).
              UNDER  NORMAL  OPERATION,  MAN WILL DISPLAY EXIT(3) IN
              PREFERENCE TO EXIT(3TCL).  TO NEGOTIATE THIS SITUATION
              AND TO AVOID HAV‐ ING TO KNOW WHICH SECTION THE PAGE YOU
              REQUIRE RESIDES IN, IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO GIVE MAN A SUB-
              EXTENSION  STRING  INDICATING  WHICH  PACKAGE THE PAGE
              MUST BELONG TO.  USING THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, SUPPLYING THE
              OPTION -E TCL TO MAN WILL RESTRICT THE SEARCH TO  PAGES
              HAVING  AN  EXTENSION  OF *TCL.

       -I, --IGNORE-CASE
              IGNORE CASE WHEN SEARCHING FOR MANUAL PAGES.  THIS IS
              THE DEFAULT.

       -I, --MATCH-CASE
              SEARCH FOR MANUAL PAGES CASE-SENSITIVELY.

       --REGEX
              SHOW  ALL  PAGES  WITH  ANY  PART OF EITHER THEIR NAMES
              OR THEIR DESCRIPTIONS MATCHING EACH PAGE ARGUMENT AS A
              REGULAR EXPRESSION, AS WITH APROPOS(1).  SINCE THERE IS
              USUALLY NO REASONABLE  WAY TO PICK A "BEST" PAGE WHEN
              SEARCHING FOR A REGULAR EXPRESSION, THIS OPTION IMPLIES -A.

       --WILDCARD
              SHOW  ALL  PAGES  WITH  ANY  PART OF EITHER THEIR NAMES
              OR THEIR DESCRIPTIONS MATCHING EACH PAGE ARGUMENT USING
              SHELL-STYLE WILDCARDS, AS WITH APROPOS(1) --WILDCARD.
              THE  PAGE  ARGUMENT  MUST MATCH  THE  ENTIRE  NAME  OR
              DESCRIPTION, OR MATCH ON WORD BOUNDARIES IN THE DESCRIPTION.
              SINCE THERE IS USUALLY NO REASONABLE WAY TO PICK A "BEST"
              PAGE WHEN SEARCHING  FOR  A  WILDCARD,  THIS OPTION
              IMPLIES -A.

       --NAMES-ONLY
              IF  THE  --REGEX  OR --WILDCARD OPTION IS USED, MATCH
              ONLY PAGE NAMES, NOT PAGE DESCRIPTIONS, AS WITH WHATIS(1).
              OTHERWISE, NO EFFECT.

       -A, --ALL
              BY DEFAULT, MAN WILL EXIT AFTER DISPLAYING THE MOST SUITABLE
              MANUAL PAGE IT FINDS.   USING  THIS OPTION FORCES MAN TO
              DISPLAY ALL THE MANUAL PAGES WITH NAMES THAT MATCH THE
              SEARCH CRITERIA.

       -U, --UPDATE
              THIS  OPTION  CAUSES MAN TO PERFORM AN `INODE LEVEL'
              CONSISTENCY CHECK ON ITS DATABASE CACHES TO ENSURE THAT
              THEY ARE AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE FILESYSTEM.
              IT WILL ONLY HAVE  A  USEFUL EFFECT IF MAN IS INSTALLED
              WITH THE SETUID BIT SET.

       --NO-SUBPAGES
              BY  DEFAULT,  MAN  WILL TRY TO INTERPRET PAIRS OF MANUAL
              PAGE NAMES GIVEN ON THE COMMAND LINE AS EQUIVALENT TO A
              SINGLE MANUAL PAGE NAME CONTAINING A HYPHEN.  THIS SUPPORTS
              THE  COMMON  PATTERN OF  PROGRAMS  THAT  IMPLEMENT A
              NUMBER OF SUBCOMMANDS, ALLOWING THEM TO PROVIDE MANUAL
              PAGES FOR EACH THAT CAN BE ACCESSED USING SIMILAR SYNTAX
              AS WOULD BE USED TO INVOKE THE SUBCOMMANDS  THEM‐ SELVES.
              FOR EXAMPLE:

                $ MAN -AW GIT DIFF /USR/SHARE/MAN/MAN1/GIT-DIFF.1.GZ

              TO DISABLE THIS BEHAVIOUR, USE THE --NO-SUBPAGES OPTION.

                $ MAN -AW --NO-SUBPAGES GIT DIFF
                /USR/SHARE/MAN/MAN1/GIT.1.GZ
                /USR/SHARE/MAN/MAN3/GIT.3PM.GZ
                /USR/SHARE/MAN/MAN1/DIFF.1.GZ

   CONTROLLING FORMATTED OUTPUT
       -P PAGER, --PAGER=PAGER
              SPECIFY  WHICH  OUTPUT  PAGER TO USE.  BY DEFAULT, MAN USES
              PAGER -S.  THIS OPTION OVERRIDES THE $MANPAGER ENVIRONMENT
              VARIABLE, WHICH IN TURN OVERRIDES THE $PAGER ENVIRONMENT
              VARIABLE.  IT  IS NOT USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH -F OR -K.

              THE  VALUE  MAY  BE A SIMPLE COMMAND NAME OR A COMMAND
              WITH ARGUMENTS, AND MAY USE SHELL QUOTING (BACKSLASHES,
              SINGLE QUOTES, OR DOUBLE QUOTES).  IT MAY NOT USE PIPES
              TO CONNECT  MULTIPLE  COM‐ MANDS;  IF  YOU NEED THAT,
              USE A WRAPPER SCRIPT, WHICH MAY TAKE THE FILE TO DISPLAY
              EITHER AS AN ARGUMENT OR ON STANDARD INPUT.

       -R PROMPT, --PROMPT=PROMPT
              IF A RECENT VERSION OF LESS IS USED AS THE PAGER, MAN WILL
              ATTEMPT TO SET ITS  PROMPT  AND  SOME SENSIBLE OPTIONS.
              THE DEFAULT PROMPT LOOKS LIKE

               MANUAL PAGE NAME(SEC) LINE X

              WHERE  NAME  DENOTES  THE MANUAL PAGE NAME, SEC DENOTES THE
              SECTION IT WAS FOUND UNDER AND X THE CURRENT LINE NUMBER.
              THIS IS ACHIEVED BY USING THE $LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.

              SUPPLYING -R WITH A STRING WILL OVERRIDE THIS DEFAULT.
              THE STRING MAY CONTAIN THE TEXT  $MAN_PN WHICH WILL BE
              EXPANDED TO THE NAME OF THE CURRENT MANUAL PAGE AND ITS
              SECTION NAME SURROUNDED BY `(' AND `)'.  THE STRING USED
              TO PRODUCE THE DEFAULT COULD BE EXPRESSED AS

              \ MANUAL\ PAGE\ \$MAN_PN\ ?LTLINE\ %LT?L/%L.: BYTE\
              %BB?S/%S..?\ (END):?PB\ %PB\\%..

              IT IS BROKEN INTO TWO LINES HERE FOR THE SAKE OF
              READABILITY ONLY.   FOR  ITS  MEANING  SEE  THE LESS(1)
              MANUAL  PAGE.   THE  PROMPT STRING IS FIRST EVALUATED BY
              THE SHELL.  ALL DOUBLE QUOTES, BACK-QUOTES AND BACKSLASHES
              IN THE PROMPT MUST BE ESCAPED BY A PRECEDING BACKSLASH.
              THE  PROMPT STRING  MAY  END  IN AN ESCAPED $ WHICH MAY
              BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER OPTIONS FOR LESS.  BY DEFAULT MAN
              SETS THE -IX8 OPTIONS.

              IF YOU WANT TO OVERRIDE MAN'S PROMPT STRING PROCESSING
              COMPLETELY, USE THE $MANLESS  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
              DESCRIBED BELOW.

       -7, --ASCII
              WHEN  VIEWING A PURE ASCII(7) MANUAL PAGE ON A 7 BIT
              TERMINAL OR TERMINAL EMULATOR, SOME CHARAC‐ TERS MAY
              NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY WHEN USING THE LATIN1(7) DEVICE
              DESCRIPTION WITH GNU NROFF.  THIS OPTION  ALLOWS PURE
              ASCII MANUAL PAGES TO BE DISPLAYED IN ASCII WITH THE
              LATIN1 DEVICE.  IT WILL NOT TRANSLATE ANY LATIN1 TEXT.
              THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE TRANSLATIONS PERFORMED: SOME
              PARTS OF IT MAY ONLY BE DISPLAYED PROPERLY WHEN USING GNU
              NROFF'S LATIN1(7) DEVICE.


              DESCRIPTION           OCTAL   LATIN1   ASCII
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              CONTINUATION HYPHEN    255      ‐        - BULLET (MIDDLE
              DOT)    267      ·        O ACUTE ACCENT           264
              ´        ' MULTIPLICATION SIGN    327      ×        X

              IF  THE  LATIN1 COLUMN DISPLAYS CORRECTLY, YOUR TERMINAL
              MAY BE SET UP FOR LATIN1 CHARACTERS AND THIS OPTION IS NOT
              NECESSARY.  IF THE LATIN1 AND ASCII COLUMNS ARE IDENTICAL,
              YOU  ARE  READING THIS PAGE USING THIS OPTION OR MAN DID
              NOT FORMAT THIS PAGE USING THE LATIN1 DEVICE DESCRIPTION.
              IF THE LATIN1 COLUMN IS MISSING OR CORRUPT, YOU MAY NEED
              TO VIEW MANUAL PAGES WITH THIS OPTION.

              THIS OPTION IS IGNORED WHEN USING OPTIONS -T, -H, -T,
              OR -Z AND MAY BE USELESS FOR  NROFF  OTHER THAN GNU'S.

       -E ENCODING, --ENCODING=ENCODING
              GENERATE  OUTPUT  FOR  A CHARACTER ENCODING OTHER THAN
              THE DEFAULT.  FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY, ENCODING MAY BE
              AN NROFF DEVICE SUCH AS ASCII, LATIN1, OR UTF8  AS  WELL
              AS  A  TRUE  CHARACTER ENCODING SUCH AS UTF-8.

       --NO-HYPHENATION, --NH
              NORMALLY,  NROFF WILL AUTOMATICALLY HYPHENATE TEXT AT LINE
              BREAKS EVEN IN WORDS THAT DO NOT CON‐ TAIN HYPHENS, IF IT
              IS NECESSARY TO DO SO TO LAY OUT WORDS ON A LINE WITHOUT
              EXCESSIVE  SPACING.  THIS  OPTION  DISABLES  AUTOMATIC
              HYPHENATION, SO WORDS WILL ONLY BE HYPHENATED IF THEY
              ALREADY CONTAIN HYPHENS.

              IF YOU ARE WRITING A MANUAL PAGE AND SIMPLY WANT TO PREVENT
              NROFF FROM HYPHENATING A WORD AT  AN INAPPROPRIATE  POINT,
              DO  NOT USE THIS OPTION, BUT CONSULT THE NROFF DOCUMENTATION
              INSTEAD; FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN PUT "\%" INSIDE A WORD
              TO INDICATE THAT IT MAY BE HYPHENATED AT THAT POINT,
              OR PUT "\%" AT THE START OF A WORD TO PREVENT IT FROM
              BEING HYPHENATED.

       --NO-JUSTIFICATION, --NJ
              NORMALLY, NROFF WILL AUTOMATICALLY JUSTIFY TEXT TO BOTH
              MARGINS.  THIS OPTION DISABLES FULL JUS‐ TIFICATION,
              LEAVING JUSTIFIED ONLY TO THE LEFT MARGIN, SOMETIMES CALLED
              "RAGGED-RIGHT" TEXT.

              IF YOU ARE WRITING A MANUAL PAGE AND SIMPLY WANT TO PREVENT
              NROFF FROM JUSTIFYING CERTAIN  PARA‐ GRAPHS,  DO  NOT USE
              THIS OPTION, BUT CONSULT THE NROFF DOCUMENTATION INSTEAD;
              FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN USE THE ".NA", ".NF", ".FI", AND ".AD"
              REQUESTS TO TEMPORARILY DISABLE ADJUSTING  AND  FILL‐ ING.

       -P STRING, --PREPROCESSOR=STRING
              SPECIFY THE SEQUENCE OF PREPROCESSORS TO RUN BEFORE NROFF
              OR TROFF/GROFF.  NOT ALL INSTALLATIONS WILL HAVE A FULL
              SET OF PREPROCESSORS.  SOME OF THE PREPROCESSORS AND THE
              LETTERS USED TO DESIG‐ NATE  THEM  ARE:  EQN (E), GRAP
              (G), PIC (P), TBL (T), VGRIND (V), REFER (R).  THIS OPTION
              OVER‐ RIDES THE $MANROFFSEQ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.
              ZSOELIM IS ALWAYS RUN AS THE VERY FIRST  PREPROCES‐ SOR.

       -T, --TROFF
              USE  GROFF -MANDOC TO FORMAT THE MANUAL PAGE TO STDOUT.
              THIS OPTION IS NOT REQUIRED IN CONJUNC‐ TION WITH -H,
              -T, OR -Z.

       -T[DEVICE], --TROFF-DEVICE[=DEVICE]
              THIS OPTION IS USED TO CHANGE GROFF (OR POSSIBLY TROFF'S)
              OUTPUT TO BE  SUITABLE  FOR  A  DEVICE OTHER  THAN  THE
              DEFAULT.   IT  IMPLIES  -T.   EXAMPLES (PROVIDED WITH
              GROFF-1.17) INCLUDE DVI, LATIN1, PS, UTF8, X75 AND X100.

       -H[BROWSER], --HTML[=BROWSER]
              THIS OPTION WILL CAUSE GROFF TO PRODUCE HTML OUTPUT,
              AND WILL  DISPLAY  THAT  OUTPUT  IN  A  WEB BROWSER.
              THE  CHOICE  OF BROWSER IS DETERMINED BY THE OPTIONAL
              BROWSER ARGUMENT IF ONE IS PRO‐ VIDED, BY THE $BROWSER
              ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE, OR BY A COMPILE-TIME DEFAULT IF
              THAT IS UNSET (USU‐ ALLY LYNX).  THIS OPTION IMPLIES -T,
              AND WILL ONLY WORK WITH GNU TROFF.

       -X[DPI], --GXDITVIEW[=DPI]
              THIS OPTION DISPLAYS THE OUTPUT OF GROFF IN A GRAPHICAL
              WINDOW USING THE GXDITVIEW PROGRAM.  THE DPI (DOTS
              PER INCH) MAY BE 75, 75-12, 100, OR 100-12, DEFAULTING
              TO 75; THE -12 VARIANTS  USE  A 12-POINT  BASE  FONT.
              THIS  OPTION  IMPLIES  -T  WITH THE X75, X75-12, X100,
              OR X100-12 DEVICE RESPECTIVELY.

       -Z, --DITROFF
              GROFF WILL RUN TROFF AND THEN USE AN APPROPRIATE
              POST-PROCESSOR TO PRODUCE OUTPUT  SUITABLE  FOR THE  CHOSEN
              DEVICE.  IF GROFF -MANDOC IS GROFF, THIS OPTION IS PASSED
              TO GROFF AND WILL SUPPRESS THE USE OF A POST-PROCESSOR.
              IT IMPLIES -T.

   GETTING HELP
       -H, --HELP
              PRINT A HELP MESSAGE AND EXIT.

       -V, --VERSION
              DISPLAY VERSION INFORMATION.

EXIT STATUS
       0      SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM EXECUTION.

       1      USAGE, SYNTAX OR CONFIGURATION FILE ERROR.

       2      OPERATIONAL ERROR.

       3      A CHILD PROCESS RETURNED A NON-ZERO EXIT STATUS.

       16     AT LEAST ONE OF THE PAGES/FILES/KEYWORDS DIDN'T EXIST OR
       WASN'T MATCHED.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              IF $MANPATH IS SET, ITS VALUE IS USED AS THE PATH TO SEARCH
              FOR MANUAL PAGES.

       MANROFFOPT
              THE CONTENTS OF $MANROFFOPT ARE ADDED TO THE COMMAND LINE
              EVERY TIME MAN INVOKES  THE  FORMATTER (NROFF, TROFF,
              OR GROFF).

       MANROFFSEQ
              IF $MANROFFSEQ IS SET, ITS VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE
              SET OF PREPROCESSORS TO PASS EACH MAN‐ UAL PAGE THROUGH.
              THE DEFAULT PREPROCESSOR LIST IS SYSTEM DEPENDENT.

       MANSECT
              IF $MANSECT IS SET, ITS VALUE IS A COLON-DELIMITED LIST
              OF SECTIONS AND IT IS USED TO  DETERMINE WHICH MANUAL
              SECTIONS TO SEARCH AND IN WHAT ORDER.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              IF  $MANPAGER  OR $PAGER IS SET ($MANPAGER IS USED IN
              PREFERENCE), ITS VALUE IS USED AS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM
              USED TO DISPLAY THE MANUAL PAGE.  BY DEFAULT, PAGER -S
              IS USED.

              THE VALUE MAY BE A SIMPLE COMMAND NAME OR A COMMAND WITH
              ARGUMENTS, AND MAY  USE  SHELL  QUOTING (BACKSLASHES,
              SINGLE  QUOTES, OR DOUBLE QUOTES).  IT MAY NOT USE PIPES
              TO CONNECT MULTIPLE COM‐ MANDS; IF YOU NEED THAT, USE A
              WRAPPER SCRIPT, WHICH MAY TAKE THE FILE TO DISPLAY EITHER
              AS  AN ARGUMENT OR ON STANDARD INPUT.

       MANLESS
              IF  $MANLESS  IS SET, MAN WILL NOT PERFORM ANY OF ITS USUAL
              PROCESSING TO SET UP A PROMPT STRING FOR THE LESS PAGER.
              INSTEAD, THE VALUE OF $MANLESS WILL BE COPIED  VERBATIM
              INTO  $LESS.   FOR EXAMPLE,  IF  YOU WANT TO SET THE
              PROMPT STRING UNCONDITIONALLY TO “MY PROMPT STRING”,
              SET $MAN‐ LESS TO ‘-PSMY PROMPT STRING’.

       BROWSER
              IF $BROWSER IS SET, ITS VALUE IS A COLON-DELIMITED LIST
              OF COMMANDS, EACH OF WHICH  IN  TURN  IS USED  TO  TRY TO
              START A WEB BROWSER FOR MAN --HTML.  IN EACH COMMAND, %S
              IS REPLACED BY A FILE‐ NAME CONTAINING THE HTML OUTPUT
              FROM GROFF, %% IS REPLACED BY A SINGLE PERCENT SIGN (%),
              AND  %C IS REPLACED BY A COLON (:).

       SYSTEM IF  $SYSTEM  IS SET, IT WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF
       IT HAD BEEN SPECIFIED AS THE ARGUMENT TO
              THE -M OPTION.

       MANOPT IF $MANOPT IS SET, IT WILL BE PARSED PRIOR TO MAN'S COMMAND
       LINE AND IS EXPECTED TO BE IN A SIM‐
              ILAR FORMAT.  AS ALL OF THE OTHER MAN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT
              VARIABLES CAN BE EXPRESSED AS COMMAND LINE OPTIONS, AND
              ARE THUS CANDIDATES FOR BEING INCLUDED IN $MANOPT IT  IS
              EXPECTED  THAT  THEY WILL  BECOME  OBSOLETE.  N.B. ALL
              SPACES THAT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS PART OF AN OPTION'S
              ARGU‐ MENT MUST BE ESCAPED.

       MANWIDTH
              IF $MANWIDTH IS SET, ITS VALUE IS USED AS THE LINE LENGTH
              FOR WHICH MANUAL PAGES SHOULD BE  FOR‐ MATTED.   IF IT IS
              NOT SET, MANUAL PAGES WILL BE FORMATTED WITH A LINE LENGTH
              APPROPRIATE TO THE CURRENT TERMINAL (USING AN IOCTL(2)
              IF AVAILABLE, THE VALUE OF $COLUMNS, OR FALLING BACK  TO
              80 CHARACTERS  IF  NEITHER IS AVAILABLE).  CAT PAGES WILL
              ONLY BE SAVED WHEN THE DEFAULT FORMATTING CAN BE USED,
              THAT IS WHEN THE TERMINAL LINE LENGTH IS BETWEEN 66 AND
              80 CHARACTERS.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              NORMALLY, WHEN OUTPUT IS NOT BEING DIRECTED TO A TERMINAL
              (SUCH AS TO A FILE OR A PIPE), FORMAT‐ TING  CHARACTERS
              ARE DISCARDED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO READ THE RESULT WITHOUT
              SPECIAL TOOLS.  HOW‐ EVER, IF $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING IS
              SET TO ANY NON-EMPTY VALUE,  THESE  FORMATTING  CHARACTERS
              ARE RETAINED.  THIS MAY BE USEFUL FOR WRAPPERS AROUND MAN
              THAT CAN INTERPRET FORMATTING CHARACTERS.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              NORMALLY,  WHEN  OUTPUT  IS  BEING DIRECTED TO A TERMINAL
              (USUALLY TO A PAGER), ANY ERROR OUTPUT FROM THE COMMAND
              USED TO PRODUCE FORMATTED VERSIONS OF MANUAL PAGES IS
              DISCARDED TO AVOID INTER‐ FERING  WITH  THE  PAGER'S
              DISPLAY.  PROGRAMS SUCH AS GROFF OFTEN PRODUCE RELATIVELY
              MINOR ERROR MESSAGES ABOUT TYPOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS SUCH
              AS POOR ALIGNMENT, WHICH ARE UNSIGHTLY AND  GENERALLY
              CONFUSING  WHEN DISPLAYED ALONG WITH THE MANUAL PAGE.
              HOWEVER, SOME USERS WANT TO SEE THEM ANY‐ WAY, SO,
              IF $MAN_KEEP_STDERR IS SET TO ANY NON-EMPTY VALUE, ERROR
              OUTPUT WILL  BE  DISPLAYED  AS USUAL.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              DEPENDING  ON SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENTATION, EITHER OR BOTH OF
              $LANG AND $LC_MESSAGES WILL BE INTER‐ ROGATED FOR THE
              CURRENT MESSAGE LOCALE.  MAN WILL DISPLAY ITS MESSAGES
              IN THAT LOCALE (IF AVAIL‐ ABLE).  SEE SETLOCALE(3)
              FOR PRECISE DETAILS.
